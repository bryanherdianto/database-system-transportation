# SDG 7 Database System for Efficient and Sustainable Energy in Transportation

## Overview

Welcome to the SDG 7 Database System project! This initiative aims to address Sustainable Development Goal 7 (SDG 7) - Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all, with a focus on efficient and sustainable energy in transportation. In this project, we are developing a database system using the C programming language to store and manage relevant data to contribute to the advancement of sustainable energy practices in the transportation sector.

## Features

- **Data Management**: Efficiently store and manage data related to sustainable energy initiatives in transportation.

- **Query System**: Implement a robust querying system to retrieve specific information from the database.

- **Security Measures**: Implement security measures to protect sensitive data and ensure the integrity of the information stored.

- **Terminal Interface**: Utilize a command-line interface for interacting with the database, enabling users to manage data through the terminal.

## Technologies Used

- **C Programming Language**: The core language for implementing the database system.

- **Terminal Interface**: Interaction with the database through the command line.
